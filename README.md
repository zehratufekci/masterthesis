Hi,

In video 1, you can see my first unknown environment and first goal location. 
Gazebo screen is on the left, rviz screen is on the right. You can see the path planning created on the Rviz screen with green color. On the Gazebo screen, the robots reach the target point without disturbing the formation.

In video 2, you can see my second unknown environment and first goal location. 
Here, when the obstacle approaches the third follower robot, we can see that the robot waits for the dynamic obstacle to go away and continues to move.

In video 3, Just like video 2, we can see that the robots go to the same target point without any dynamic obstacles, so the formation is intact.
